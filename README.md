# Uptick React Project

### Project

Create a front end application and use a state management tool e.g. Context API or Redux to pass  global data passed across the application e.g. login api response etc. Connect it to [this Backend App](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26756602/2sA3dyjBw6) built in the previous week. More emphasis will be placed on app functionality.

### Requirements

- Implement functionality.

- Enable users to create and log into their account.

- Allow users to create and update blog posts.

- Allow users to fetch all posts and get details of a single post.

- The application should fetch the data from the [backend API](https://github.com/Perpy-del/uptick_sqltomdb).

- Provide an option to delete blog posts from the list.

### Technologies Used:
-   [React with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - React is a library that is used to build websites based on Reusable Components. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for web projects.
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
-   [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) - Beautifully designed reusable components that you can copy and paste into your application.

### Browser Storage
- [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - localStorage is used to save key/value pairs in the browser. This was used to store the user name.
